# combine1090
Combine data from multiple dump1090 / readsb receivers (or other receivers providing beast protocol data)

Does not interfere with an already configured dump1090-fa / readsb but instead creates another instance with its own webinterface at /combine1090

Should work on the adsbexchange / piaware sd-card images.

## Installation:
```
sudo bash -c "$(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/combine1090/master/install.sh)"
```
or
```
wget -O /tmp/combine1090.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/combine1090/master/install.sh
sudo bash /tmp/combine1090.sh
```

## Configuration:

Edit /etc/default/combine1090 to configure which IP addresses this script should get the ADS-B data from
```
sudo nano /etc/default/combine1090
```
Ctrl-x to exit, y (yes) to save when asked.
Then restart combine1090:
```
sudo systemctl restart combine1090 combine1090-dump
```

## Install data redirection only
```
sudo bash -c "$(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiedehopf/combine1090/master/redirect-only.sh)"
```
Configure SOURCES (source ips), PORTs (source ports) and TARGET (target ip and port) in /etc/default/combine1090.
There will be no dedicated readsb started as a target for data redirection, you need to provide that target yourself.
Also as there is no extra readsb there will be no extra web page or lighttpd configuration.
